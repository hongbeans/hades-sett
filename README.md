Requires [Mod Importer](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/26) and [ModUtil](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/27).

**This mod is best experienced with Voice Volume muted in the settings.**

How to install:
1. Download and extract [Mod Importer](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/26). Place `modimporter.exe` in `{Hades root folder}\Content\`.
    - To find the `Content` folder:
        - Steam: Library > Right-click on Hades > Manage > Browse local files > Content
        - Epic Games: ` C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Hades\Content`
        - Microsoft Store: `<location you chose when installing via the Store>\Hades\Content\Content`
    - For MacOS, note that you can open the game app package as a folder by right-clicking and selecting "Show Package Contents". The folder to look for instead is `{Hades root folder}\Content\Resources\Contents`.
2. Create a `Mods` folder in the `Content` folder from step 1, if one does not exist yet.
3. Download and extract [ModUtil](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/27). Place the `ModUtil` folder in the `Mods` folder created in step 2.
4. Download and extract this mod. Place the extracted folder into your `Mods` folder.
5. Run `modimporter.exe`. Once it finishes running, the mod should be loaded and you can start playing!
