Requires [Mod Importer](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/26) and [ModUtil](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/27).

**This mod is best experienced with Voice Volume muted in the settings.**

## How to install:
1. Download and extract [Mod Importer](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/26). Place `modimporter.exe` in `{Hades root folder}\Content\`.
    - To find the `Content` folder:
        - Steam: Library > Right-click on Hades > Manage > Browse local files > Content
        - Epic Games: ` C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Hades\Content`
        - Microsoft Store: `<location you chose when installing via the Store>\Hades\Content\Content`
    - For MacOS, note that you can open the game app package as a folder by right-clicking and selecting "Show Package Contents". The folder to look for instead is `{Hades root folder}\Content\Resources\Contents`.
2. Create a `Mods` folder in the `Content` folder from step 1, if one does not exist yet.
3. Download and extract [ModUtil](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/27). Place the `ModUtil` folder in the `Mods` folder created in step 2.
4. Download and extract this mod. Place the extracted folder into your `Mods` folder.
5. Run `modimporter.exe`. Once it finishes running, the mod should be loaded and you can start playing!

**To uninstall the mod**, delete this mod from your `Mods` folder and run `modimporter.exe` afterwards. If some things are still modified (e.g. subtitles), verify your game files on the platform you installed the game from (Steam, Epic Games, etc.) to revert the game back to its original state.
