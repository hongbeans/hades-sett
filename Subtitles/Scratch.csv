Integrated,Scratch_,0011,Scratch_0011,,,,"Let me give you a piece of advice, my friend. If you see any other mummies out there, don't ask any questions. Just give 'em a good stab in the back before he sends you crying back to Big Papa over there.",,,

Integrated,Scratch_,0018,Scratch_0018,,,,"Tell him for me, please.",,,
Integrated,Scratch_,0019,Scratch_0019,,,,"I'm, uh, kind of in the middle of a set here, Sett, if you don't mind? Shouldn't interrupt your father's music hour. 'Course, you're welcome to stay and have a listen, if you want....",,,
Integrated,Scratch_,0020,Scratch_0020,,,,"Oh, uh, hey Sett, I was just... reminiscing I suppose, about my brother. You know him right? Still trapped somewhere out there, and all because of me. What I got us into. I don't deserve it but... I wish I could ask for his forgiveness.",,,
Integrated,Scratch_,0021,Scratch_0021,,,,"Wait wait wait back up, back up a moment, Sett, you're telling me you saw him? My brother is out there? And he said... all of that? I... I don't, I don't know what to say, I... I think I need a moment here.",,,

Integrated,Scratch_,0024,Scratch_0024,,,,"You've quite the fighting spirit in you there, I have to say. Most intriguing. Though, no surprise for someone born in hell itself. I happen to be a student of death, you know. You come on out of there, and tell me all about it.",,,
Integrated,Scratch_,0025,Scratch_0025,,,,"Heeey, there, Sett, how's it going? Look, you have got to get here with the rest of us already, we been saving you a spot! Let me see what I can do, make life a little more fun for you in the meantime....",,,
Darren,Scratch_,0026,Scratch_0026,,,,"Hello, Sett, it's me! Look, let me see what I can do to help. I've been shepherding souls down there practically forever and I always figured you don't belong there anyhow. So let's get you out!",,,
Darren,Scratch_,0027,Scratch_0027,,,,"Well I must say, and I don't say it lightly: I'm impressed with your performance, Settrigh. I didn't know what to expect, either, but! You've earned my favor. Now, hasten from that place already, and join your rightful family, up here.",,,
