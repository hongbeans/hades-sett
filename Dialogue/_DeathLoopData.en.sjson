        Persephone: ...I spent many days tending this garden... or nights? Quite difficult to tell the time here. But, it's held on longer than I would have expected...
        Hades: ...Lihua... I...
        Persephone: Truffle, Southpaw! I missed you so. And dutiful as ever, aren't you.
        Hades: ...I'm sorry. Know that I am sorry.
        Persephone: You... you look tired. Though, I am not the only one you ought to be apologizing to.
        Hades: I know. I know, I.... Why have you returned? If the Spirit Realm... if your mother discovers what happened, not even Volibear, not even {#DialogueItalicFormat}he {#PreviousFormat}could stop what would transpire, here!
        Persephone: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Oh{#PreviousFormat}, I've a thought or two about how we can settle that. Though I shall need for you and Settrigh to cooperate with me on a solution. Or, if you'd rather, I could just return the way I came?
        Hades: A solution? What, do you intend to have them over for Ambrosia? Not even you can fix a broken family, Lihua.
        Persephone: You're right! I can't. Certainly not by myself. So, are you going to help me, or what?
        Hades: ...I would do anything that you would ask of me.
        Persephone: Then, first, talk to your son.
        Hades: ...{#DialogueItalicFormat}Mm{#PreviousFormat}. Settrigh? You have already met Lihua, our Queen. I expect for you to show deference to her, at all times!
        Zagreus: Wow, Pop! You called me by my name! What's this feelin' I got? Maybe it's this {#DialogueItalicFormat}deference {#PreviousFormat} you like so much?
        Persephone: Oh, stop it, both of you. Don't make me regret this, you old timer. Speak honestly with him. About yourself, not me. Go on.
        Hades: Yes. I... Settrigh. I know there have been times... when I've let my mood reflect on you. I showed very little patience. Questioned your judgment, often, when my own was flawed. And there were times... where I abandoned you. Thus, I apologize to you, my son. I have no excuses. And I ask no forgiveness.
        Zagreus: What about how ya lied to me 'bout Momma, are ya sorry for that? Your bad moods, treatin' me like your punchin' bag... leavin' me when I needed you most... I learned a long time ago to expect that. And I hated ya for it. But I always thought... at least you're honest.
        Hades: Your mother cut all ties with her tribe to start a family of her own. When she left... believing you were stillborn... she was utterly heartbroken. But I believed that she was better off without the lot of us, the Spirit Realm included. Deceiving both of you... it tore against my being. But now you see that it was never she that abandoned us, but only my own doing. I did it to keep her safe.
        Zagreus: And then ya went 'n vented all that 'inner turmoil' onto me my whole life. I guess I understand, though. Just wish I coulda understood sooner. So, uh... what now? I got so used to ransacking your domain, I think I'm really gonna miss it.
        Hades: About that... your {#DialogueItalicFormat}ransacking {#PreviousFormat}revealed many flaws in our security. The types that never get into reports. Our reputation rides on there being no escape from here. Would you... keep trying to break free? Not for my sake. But for this realm. For the Queen.
        Persephone: Settrigh... If you keep fighting out of here... it shall help keep appearances that everything is as it always was.
        Zagreus: Question, old timer. Let's say I agree. When next I get to the surface... is it still gonna be you waitin' up there?
        Hades: Ah, boy. If you think for an instant that I shall go easier on you because of this, you'll soon learn otherwise.
        Zagreus: So I just fight to the surface and repeatedly beat the shit outta my own dad?
        Hades: You have it half-correct!
        Persephone: Perhaps you'll also tend to my little cottage while you're in the area? The garden doesn't take much care at all. I'd like to keep the place in decent shape. In case I cannot suffer this for long.
        Zagreus: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Hahaha{#PreviousFormat}, well! I guess I'll see what I can do.
        Persephone: Just do the best you can. And, clearly, I've work to do as well. We have a lot of it ahead of us, I'd say. So, shall we get started, then?
        Zagreus: {#DialogueItalicFormat}After all this time{#PreviousFormat}, it's only been a few days! But it's been good. Ma 'n Pa are back together, made some new friends, 'n I got this fancy paintin'! Easy.

        Zagreus: What about how ya lied to me 'bout Momma, are ya sorry for that? Your bad moods, treatin' me like your punchin' bag... leavin' me when I needed you most... I learned a long time ago to expect that. And I hated ya for it. But I always thought... at least you're honest.
        Hades: Your mother cut all ties with her tribe to start a family of her own. When she left... believing you were stillborn... she was utterly heartbroken. But I believed that she was better off without the lot of us, the Spirit Realm included. Deceiving both of you... it tore against my being. But now you see that it was never she that abandoned us, but only my own doing. I did it to keep her safe.
        Zagreus: And then ya went 'n vented all that 'inner turmoil' onto me my whole life. I guess I understand, though. Just wish I coulda understood sooner. So, uh... what now? I got so used to ransacking your domain, I think I'm really gonna miss it.
        Hades: About that... your {#DialogueItalicFormat}ransacking {#PreviousFormat}revealed many flaws in our security. The types that never get into reports. Our reputation rides on there being no escape from here. Would you... keep trying to break free? Not for my sake. But for this realm. For the Queen.
        Persephone: Settrigh... If you keep fighting out of here... it shall help keep appearances that everything is as it always was.
        Zagreus: Question, old timer. Let's say I agree. When next I get to the surface... is it still gonna be you waitin' up there?
        Hades: Ah, boy. If you think for an instant that I shall go easier on you because of this, you'll soon learn otherwise.
        Zagreus: So I just fight to the surface and repeatedly beat the shit outta my own dad?
        Hades: You have it half-correct!
        Persephone: Perhaps you'll also tend to my little cottage while you're in the area? The garden doesn't take much care at all. I'd like to keep the place in decent shape. In case I cannot suffer this for long.
        Zagreus: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Hahaha{#PreviousFormat}, well! I guess I'll see what I can do.
        Persephone: Just do the best you can. And, clearly, I've work to do as well. We have a lot of it ahead of us, I'd say. So, shall we get started, then?

        Persephone: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Oh{#PreviousFormat}, I've a thought or two about how we can settle that. Though I shall need for you and Settrigh to cooperate with me on a solution. Or, if you'd rather, I could just return the way I came?
        Hades: A solution? What, do you intend to have them over for Ambrosia? Not even you can fix a broken family, Lihua.
        Persephone: You're right! I can't. Certainly not by myself. So, are you going to help me, or what?
        Hades: ...I would do anything that you would ask of me.
        Persephone: Then, first, talk to your son.
        Hades: ...{#DialogueItalicFormat}Mm{#PreviousFormat}. Settrigh? You have already met Lihua, our Queen. I expect for you to show deference to her, at all times!

        Persephone: Oh, stop it, both of you. Don't make me regret this, you old timer. Speak honestly with him. About yourself, not me. Go on.
        Hades: Yes. I... Settrigh. I know there have been times... when I've let my mood reflect on you. I showed very little patience. Questioned your judgment, often, when my own was flawed. And there were times... where I abandoned you. Thus, I apologize to you, my son. I have no excuses. And I ask no forgiveness.
        Zagreus: What about how ya lied to me 'bout Momma, are ya sorry for that? Your bad moods, treatin' me like your punchin' bag... leavin' me when I needed you most... I learned a long time ago to expect that. And I hated ya for it. But I always thought... at least you're honest.
        Hades: Your mother cut all ties with her tribe to start a family of her own. When she left... believing you were stillborn... she was utterly heartbroken. But I believed that she was better off without the lot of us, the Spirit Realm included. Deceiving both of you... it tore against my being. But now you see that it was never she that abandoned us, but only my own doing. I did it to keep her safe.
        Zagreus: And then ya went 'n vented all that 'inner turmoil' onto me my whole life. I guess I understand, though. Just wish I coulda understood sooner. So, uh... what now? I got so used to ransacking your domain, I think I'm really gonna miss it.
        Hades: About that... your {#DialogueItalicFormat}ransacking {#PreviousFormat}revealed many flaws in our security. The types that never get into reports. Our reputation rides on there being no escape from here. Would you... keep trying to break free? Not for my sake. But for this realm. For the Queen.
        Persephone: Settrigh... If you keep fighting out of here... it shall help keep appearances that everything is as it always was.
        Zagreus: Question, old timer. Let's say I agree. When next I get to the surface... is it still gonna be you waitin' up there?
        Hades: Ah, boy. If you think for an instant that I shall go easier on you because of this, you'll soon learn otherwise.
        Zagreus: So I just fight to the surface and repeatedly beat the shit outta my own dad?
        Hades: You have it half-correct!
        Persephone: Perhaps you'll also tend to my little cottage while you're in the area? The garden doesn't take much care at all. I'd like to keep the place in decent shape. In case I cannot suffer this for long.
        Zagreus: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Hahaha{#PreviousFormat}, well! I guess I'll see what I can do.
        Persephone: Just do the best you can. And, clearly, I've work to do as well. We have a lot of it ahead of us, I'd say. So, shall we get started, then?

        Hades: Your mother cut all ties with her tribe to start a family of her own. When she left... believing you were stillborn... she was utterly heartbroken. But I believed that she was better off without the lot of us, the Spirit Realm included. Deceiving both of you... it tore against my being.

        Persephone: ...I spent many days tending this garden... or nights? Quite difficult to tell the time here. But, it's held on longer than I would have expected...
        Hades: ...Lihua... I...
        Persephone: Truffle, Southpaw! I missed you so. And dutiful as ever, aren't you.
        Hades: ...I'm sorry. Know that I am sorry.
        Persephone: You... you look tired. Though, I am not the only one you ought to be apologizing to.
        Hades: I know. I know, I.... Why have you returned? If the Spirit Realm... if your mother discovers what happened, not even Volibear, not even {#DialogueItalicFormat}he {#PreviousFormat}could stop what would transpire, here!
        Persephone: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Oh{#PreviousFormat}, I've a thought or two about how we can settle that. Though I shall need for you and Settrigh to cooperate with me on a solution. Or, if you'd rather, I could just return the way I came?
        Hades: A solution? What, do you intend to have them over for Ambrosia? Not even you can fix a broken family, Lihua.
        Persephone: You're right! I can't. Certainly not by myself. So, are you going to help me, or what?
        Hades: ...I would do anything that you would ask of me.
        Persephone: Then, first, talk to your son.
        Hades: ...{#DialogueItalicFormat}Mm{#PreviousFormat}. Settrigh? You have already met Lihua, our Queen. I expect for you to show deference to her, at all times!
        Zagreus: Wow, Pop! You called me by my name! What's this feelin' I got? Maybe it's this {#DialogueItalicFormat}deference {#PreviousFormat} you like so much?
        Persephone: Oh, stop it, both of you. Don't make me regret this, you old timer. Speak honestly with him. About yourself, not me. Go on.
        Hades: Yes. I... Settrigh. I know there have been times... when I've let my mood reflect on you. I showed very little patience. Questioned your judgment, often, when my own was flawed. And there were times... where I abandoned you. Thus, I apologize to you, my son. I have no excuses. And I ask no forgiveness.
        Zagreus: What about how ya lied to me 'bout Momma, are ya sorry for that? Your bad moods, treatin' me like your punchin' bag... leavin' me when I needed you most... I learned a long time ago to expect that. And I hated ya for it. But I always thought... at least you're honest.
        Hades: Your mother cut all ties with her tribe to start a family of her own. When she left... believing you were stillborn... she was utterly heartbroken. But I believed that she was better off without the lot of us, the Spirit Realm included. Deceiving both of you... it tore against my being. But now you see that it was never she that abandoned us, but only my own doing. I did it to keep her safe.
        Zagreus: And then ya went 'n vented all that 'inner turmoil' onto me my whole life. I guess I understand, though. Just wish I coulda understood sooner. So, uh... what now? I got so used to ransacking your domain, I think I'm really gonna miss it.
        Hades: About that... your {#DialogueItalicFormat}ransacking {#PreviousFormat}revealed many flaws in our security. The types that never get into reports. Our reputation rides on there being no escape from here. Would you... keep trying to break free? Not for my sake. But for this realm. For the Queen.
        Persephone: Settrigh... If you keep fighting out of here... it shall help keep appearances that everything is as it always was.
        Zagreus: Question, old timer. Let's say I agree. When next I get to the surface... is it still gonna be you waitin' up there?
        Hades: Ah, boy. If you think for an instant that I shall go easier on you because of this, you'll soon learn otherwise.
        Zagreus: So I just fight to the surface and repeatedly beat the shit outta my own dad?
        Hades: You have it half-correct!
        Persephone: Perhaps you'll also tend to my little cottage while you're in the area? The garden doesn't take much care at all. I'd like to keep the place in decent shape. In case I cannot suffer this for long.
